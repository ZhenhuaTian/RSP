ACL 2013: A Random Walk Approach to Selectional Preferences Based on Preference Ranking and Propagation

We are very glad to share the implemented code and related data.

Due to the access issues from mainland China to GitHub, we can not timely update the RSP package.

Please download the code and resource at: http://pan.baidu.com/disk/home#dir/path=%2FRSP_Selectional_Preferences

If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact us at zhhtian@gmail.com. Thank you!
